## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I have learned to create an accessible menu layout both for mobile and desktop. Specifically, I've learned about WCAG 2.1 1.4.13 criteria (Content on Hover or Focus) and the requirement to provide a keyboard based method to close an open navigation dropdown menu.

### Continued development

In a future project I would try implementing a full keyboard navigation, with support for arrow, home and end keys.
I'd also would like to continue practicing responsive images.

### Useful resources

- [Modern CSS](https://moderncss.dev/css-only-accessible-dropdown-navigation-menu/) - Provides a great explanation on how to create an accessible dropdown menu.
- [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) Example Disclosure Navigation Menu](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/disclosure/disclosure-navigation.html#mythical-page-content) - Explains how to create an accessible disclosure navigation menu, the aria requirements for each element and the mandatory keyboard support.

Kudos to Kevin Powell's solution to the Space Tourism Website challenge in Scrimba, as he provides an elegant solution for responsive mobile navigation and very unseful information regarding accessibility requirements.
